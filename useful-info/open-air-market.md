# Open air market

Many of the local towns have their own open air markets which are a great place to go and pick some fruits, nuts and veggies. They tend to take place from 09:00 to 14:00 approximately. They tend to be very busy in summer and this means an increased risk from the pick pockets. So a word of advice, don't carry large amounts of cash with you and keep it very close to you at all times.
