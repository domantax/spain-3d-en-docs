# Murcia

## About

Murcia the capital city of the region is well worth a visit. You can travel here by regular bus services from Puerto de Mazarron or take your car. There is ample cheap parking available in the city centre.

Be sure to visit the magnificent cathedral with 23 individual chapels.

The cathedral took over 400 years to build and as such has a varied selection of architecture. Wander around the many narrow lanes and streets soaking up the local atmosphere. Be sure to visit the Casino on Calle Traperia and enjoy a coffee here. Menu del Dia is still very cheap in the city centre or you can enjoy tapas at one of the many tapas bars. There are many designer shops in the city but the main shopping malls are now situated a short car or bus ride just outside the city.
