# Cartagena

## About

Cartagena is the second city of the region. The city dates back to Roman times and it still has some original Roman architecture including the recently restored open air Roman theatre. The city is best explored on foot and can be reached by bus or car only 25 mins journey. Why not take time to have a cruise around the bay on the tourist boat and enjoy the views of the city from a different angle. Be sure to visit the war museum and take the glass lift to the castle which overlooks the marina. Here you can have a drink in the wonderful gardens and enjoy the peacocks as they strut their plumes for all to admire. You can also enjoy excellent aerial views of the Roman theatre and the marina from the castle grounds.

Cartagena now has an open deck tourist bus which visits all the major places of interest. You can pick this up at the top of Calle Mayor or outside the tourist office near the bus station. The local council offer free bike hire and this can be arranged at the tourist office in City Hall. Cartagena is still a working Naval Port and is also a stop off point for many cruise liners. You may see the odd submarine or warship entering the naval base as you stroll along the marina. If you are visiting during the middle to the end of September be sure to visit the Cartagenian and Roman festival which takes place over 10 days/nights.
