# Lorca

## About

Lorca can be reached in just under 1 hour either by car or bus. It is another historic town dating back to the Moors and Christian times.

Lorca is one of the most majestic towns in the region and has been declared a city of Historical and Artistic interest. On arrival follow signs for the Visitor Centre. You can park here and during high season there is a road train which will take you up to the castle (Fortress of the Sun). Here you can enjoy a guided tour of the castle with actors playing the parts of characters from times past.

Lorca has a good shopping area with lots of nice caf√© bars to enjoy tapas or just a drink. There is also a large open air market held here every Thursday.
