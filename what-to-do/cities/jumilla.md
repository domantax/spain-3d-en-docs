## About

The Jumilla wine region in the north east of the region is well worth a visit for wine lovers. The journey time by car is just over 2 hours from the apartment. There are many vineyards and bodegas to visit for wine tasting and to purchase your favourite tipple. While you are here take time to visit the old town of Jumilla and stroll around its streets to discover the Vico Theatre, the Church of Santiago and the Archaeological Museum.
