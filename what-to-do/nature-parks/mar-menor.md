# Mar Menor - Mud baths

Small lakes with very warm water, and deck and step access provided. People bathe in these pools and smear the mud from the bottom over their bodies. The mud is reportedly excellent for damaged skin and for arthritic pain.

Don't forget to take some bucket - you will need it to grab mud from sea floor and bring it back to the shore - to apply it on your body

## About

Covering an area of 170km, the Mar Menor is the largest salt water lake in Europe, The water is only 7 metres deep at its lowest point, and is edged with kilometre after kilometre of sandy beaches sloping gently into the water, creating a shallow, sandy fringe, which warms to an extraordinary degree during the summer months. It is possible in many places to be 50 metres out from the shore, and still only be standing knee deep in the water.

Whilst the Mar Menor, is a popular location for leisure sports, fishing and beach holidays, its also known as the sea of health because of its warm waters, high salinity and healing muds.

The therapeutic properties of mud have been known since antiquity and used in both medical and beauty treatments for thousands of years. Special climatic conditions in the Mar Menor, and the surrounding salinas,  have brought about clay deposits which contain a high percentage of positive ions, calcium, magnesium, potassium and fluoride, in addition to negative ions, chlorine and sulphate, which combine with extraordinarily fine sand to create a unique, healing mud.
