## About

Sierra Espuna National Park is situated near Totana and is about 45 mins drive from the apartment. This area is great for those who enjoy the outdoor life. Walking, mountain biking, quad biking and paragliding are some of the activities practiced here. For the not so energetic why not just enjoy the magnificent scenery as you drive through this vast park. Stop off at one of the many restaurants for drinks or an excellent lunch as the eagles glide overhead. Visit the ancient medieval village of Aledo on the Totana side of the park and also the monastery of Saint Eulalia which in recent years has been converted into a hotel. The original 13th century church is still here and mass is celebrated here regularly. Lots of pilgrims visit this site and it can become very busy at weekends. If you ever wondered what it would be like to walk on the moon, and then visit the lunar landscapes of the Barrancos de Gebas on the Alhama de Murcia side of the park. The singular rock formations and absence of vegetation in this very unusual area are sure to make you feel as if you are on the moon. If you fancy living with nature for a night or two why not camp at the designated sites in the park, or rent a log cabin.
