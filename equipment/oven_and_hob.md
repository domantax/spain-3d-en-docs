# Oven, Microwave and Hob

The oven and microwave are electric and hopefully the controls are self explanatory.

The hob is gas. The knob on the pipe must be in vertical position for gas to flow. If gas does not flow, then you need to pull the valve under the handle towards you and hold it for 4-5 seconds.
