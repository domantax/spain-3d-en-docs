# Rubbish

In this area, rubbish is collected every day, from the large green wheelie bins that are on the sides of the roads and at many junctions and in our case as you enter the development. Please remember to put your rubbish in the bins daily and especially put all your rubbish in the bin the day you are leaving. In summer, it is preferred if you put the rubbish in the bin after 9pm, this is to try and reduce the number of people opening the bins and attracting flies.
