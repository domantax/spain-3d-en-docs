# General supplies in the appartment

When you arrive in the apartment, you may find some basic supplies: for example in the kitchen: sugar, coffee, tea. In the bathrooms: toilet paper and soap. When you depart it would be appreciated if you could leave a small amount of each supply for the next guests.
