# Air Conditioning

This apartment has air conditioning and heating. It is important to set control panel appropriately for the time of the year. Symbols you see on the control panel: 
a) sun - heating of rooms during the winter months.
b) snowflake - cooling of rooms during summer months.
Once this setting is correct, you can turn  air conditioning / heating on and modify room temperature.

The air conditioning / heating unit can be quite expensive to run: therefore in order to keep our costs down, we would ask you to use it sparingly. If you are using the air conditioning, please remember to close all the windows and doors as the system is thermostatically controlled.
