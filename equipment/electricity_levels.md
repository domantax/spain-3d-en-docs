# Electricity Levels

Something you may not be used to is the level of electricity we get in Spain as standard. It is 5.5kw which means that if you have the water heater on (2kw), the electric kettle on (2kw) and then you plug the iron in (2kw) the system will trip. What you need to do if this happens is unplug something to reduce the amount of kw you are using and go to the fuse box inside the front in order to re-set the fuse that has tripped. This is standard in Spain and something you get used to in time, even though it can be frustrating!
